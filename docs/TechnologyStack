🌐 Frontend (Client Side)

Framework: React + Vite + TypeScript
Routing: React Router
Styling: Tailwind CSS (with optional shadcn/ui)

Framework: Express.js + TypeScript
API Design: REST API (MVC architecture)
Validation: Zod (schema-based input validation)
Documentation: Swagger (OpenAPI)

Purpose:
Handles business logic, authentication, supplier management, RFQs, and order tracking.

🗄️ Database and ORM

Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: Prisma
Deployment: Local (Docker) for development, Neon/Supabase for cloud

Purpose:
Stores all application data — users, suppliers, RFQs, and orders. Prisma simplifies database access and schema management.

🔐 Authentication & Security

Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT)
Password Encryption: bcrypt
Environment Variables: dotenv
Security Middleware: Helmet, CORS

Purpose:
Ensures secure, role-based access for Admin, Buyer, Supplier, and Internal Staff.

📂 File Uploads & Media

Service: Cloudinary

Purpose:
Handles supplier compliance certificate uploads securely in both development and production environments.

✉️ Notifications & Communication

Email Service: Mailtrap (development) → Nodemailer / Resend (production)
Real-Time Updates: Simple polling (Socket.IO optional later)

Purpose:
Sends notifications for RFQ responses, order confirmations, and system updates.

💳 Payments (Future Implementation)

Service: Stripe (Test/Sandbox mode)

Purpose:
Prepares a framework for future secure payment simulations using test keys.

🧾 Audit & Logging

Logger: Pino + Pino Pretty

Purpose:
Maintains clear server logs and user/system activity tracking for debugging.

🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

Frontend: Vitest
Backend: Jest + Supertest
Linting & Formatting: ESLint + Prettier

Purpose:
Automated testing to maintain quality and prevent bugs.

☁️ Deployment & CI/CD

Frontend Hosting: Vercel
Backend Hosting: Render / Railway
Database Hosting: Neon / Supabase
CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Purpose:
Continuous integration and cloud deployment for collaborative team workflow.

🧭 Project Management & Documentation

Tools: Google Drive, Notion, GitHub Projects, WBS, Gantt Chart

Purpose:
For collaborative planning, documentation, and weekly progress tracking.

✅ Summary

This stack is designed to:

Support fast and scalable student development.
